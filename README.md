# Array Manipulation in JavaScript

## Reflection Questions

1: With help of push, adding new item to the array become easier and faster, with help of filter I manage to prevent adding the similar item to the array and also I filter the list when user search data thought search input.

2: First I used change in eventListener on input and it did not work when user is writing in the input, I must click on the outside to see the result, Then I use the input listener on input and the problem solved. Now user has realtime filter

3:

- Save the list
- Add edit for items
- Add delete button for each item
- Show user some errors for example the button Add right now does not working because you try to add duplicate data or the input is empty.
